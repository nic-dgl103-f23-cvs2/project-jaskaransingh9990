        <p class="desktop">Congratulations on taking the first step toward improving your pelvic health! We know it can be intimidating but our goal at Full Moon is to make the experience comfortable and positive from start to finish. 

            We take a whole-body, exercise-based approach to your care - you are more than just your pelvis and you wonâ€™t spend your whole appointment laying down! Our therapists also aim to address the body from a biopsychosocial lens. This means we look not only at the muscles and tissues but also at your social and emotional well-being as it relates to your experience in your body.
            
            All of our physiotherapists have completed specialized training in treating pelvic floor and prenatal/postpartum concerns. We pride ourselves on providing the best care possible to all of our clients by regularly taking courses to update our skills, engaging in mentorship within the clinic and creating strong professional connections with other caregivers in the Comox Valley.</p>
